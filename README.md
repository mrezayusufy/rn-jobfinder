# JobFinder RN

üîçüìùüëã A React Native job finder app with search, job detail, and welcome pages.

## Description

This is a React Native app that helps you find job opportunities that match your skills and interests. With a simple and intuitive interface, you can search for jobs, view job details, and save jobs for later. The app also features a welcome page that introduces you to its features and helps you get started.

I worked very hard on this app to make it perfect for job seekers like you. I used the latest technologies and best practices to ensure that the app is fast, reliable, and easy to use. One of the challenges I faced was configuring the app using an `.env` file. However, I was able to overcome this challenge by carefully following the documentation and experimenting with different configurations.

I also used RapidAPI to access job listings from various sources. RapidAPI allowed me to easily integrate multiple APIs into my app and retrieve job data in a consistent format.

## Features

- Search for jobs by keyword and location
- View job details, including company name, job title, salary, and more
- Save jobs for later viewing
- Welcome page with information about the app and its features
